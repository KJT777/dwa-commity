    <h1> Shallow <br>Lady Gaga, Bradley Cooper </h1>
    <p> Tell me somethin', girl<br>
Are you happy in this modern world?<br>
Or do you need more?<br>
Is there somethin' else you're searchin' for?<br>
I'm falling<br>
In all the good times I find myself<br>
Longin' for change<br>
And in the bad times I fear myself<br>
Tell me something, boy<br>
Aren't you tired tryin' to fill that void?<br>
Or do you need more?<br>
Ain't it hard keeping it so hardcore?<br>
I'm falling<br>
In all the good times I find myself<br>
Longing for a change<br>
And in the bad times I fear myself<br>
I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in<br>
I'll never meet the ground<br>
Crash through the surface, where they can't hurt us<br>
We're far from the shallow now<br>
In the shallow, shallow<br>
In the shallow, shallow<br>
In the shallow, shallow<br>
We're far fromâ€¦
